# The Bee

The Bee is comprised of 3 parts:

1. The **front end**, written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
2. The **back end**: the API (written in Python), and a directory of plain text files which contains the games
3. The **Game Getter** scripts, written in Python and Bash. 

The Game Getter and the games are currently private repositories.
